# gains_of_interconnected_systems
This repository assists in calculating the composite gains of interconnected systems.


Run ``main.mlx'' by using MATLAB!


In our system, gains are defined from $x_1$ to $x_2$, from $x_2$ to $x_3$, from $x_3$ to $x_2$, and from $x_3$ to $x_1$. 
After performing the calculation, the resulting paths and gains are shown on the right side.
